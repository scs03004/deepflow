# Claude Code + Deepflow MCP: Development Workflow Examples

This document showcases real-world examples of using Deepflow MCP tools with Claude Code during development sessions.

## 🎯 Workflow 1: New Feature Development

**Scenario**: Adding a new authentication module to a Flask application

### Step 1: Initial Analysis
**You**: "I need to add JWT authentication to this Flask app. First, analyze the current architecture."

**Claude Code**: 
```
I'll analyze your project structure and dependencies to understand the current architecture.
```
*Uses `analyze_dependencies` tool*

**Result**: 
- Current auth system uses session-based authentication
- Dependencies: Flask, Flask-Session, SQLAlchemy
- No circular dependencies detected
- 3 modules in auth-related code

### Step 2: Planning Integration
**You**: "Show me potential integration points and any coupling issues"

**Claude Code**:
```
Let me analyze code quality and coupling to identify the best integration approach.
```
*Uses `analyze_code_quality` with `coupling` analysis*

**Result**:
- High coupling between `auth` and `users` modules
- Suggested refactoring: Extract auth interface
- Recommended integration points identified

### Step 3: Implementation
**You**: "Help me implement JWT authentication with minimal coupling"

**Claude Code**: 
*Implements JWT authentication following architectural recommendations*

### Step 4: Impact Validation
**You**: "Validate these changes before I commit"

**Claude Code**:
```
I'll validate your changes and check for any architectural violations.
```
*Uses `validate_commit` tool*

**Result**:
- No circular dependencies introduced
- 2 new test files needed
- Documentation updates required for auth module

### Step 5: Documentation Update
**You**: "Generate updated architecture documentation"

**Claude Code**:
```
I'll generate updated documentation reflecting the new authentication system.
```
*Uses `generate_documentation` with `architecture_overview`*

**Result**: 
- Updated dependency map showing JWT integration
- API documentation for new auth endpoints
- Architecture overview with security flow diagrams

## 🧹 Workflow 2: Technical Debt Cleanup

**Scenario**: Cleaning up a legacy codebase before a major release

### Initial Assessment
**You**: "This codebase has grown organically. Help me identify and prioritize technical debt."

**Claude Code**:
```
I'll perform comprehensive code quality analysis to identify technical debt.
```
*Uses `analyze_code_quality` with `all` analysis types*

**Analysis Results**:
```
Technical Debt Report:
===================

High Priority Issues:
1. Circular dependencies (3 found)
   - models.py ↔ services.py 
   - auth/views.py ↔ auth/decorators.py
   - utils/helpers.py ↔ core/processors.py

2. Unused imports (47 found across 23 files)
   - Estimated cleanup time: 2-3 hours
   - Potential performance improvement: 5-10%

3. High coupling modules:
   - core/manager.py (coupling score: 8.5/10)
   - auth/service.py (coupling score: 7.2/10)
   - data/repository.py (coupling score: 6.8/10)

4. Large files exceeding AI context windows:
   - core/manager.py: 2,847 tokens (recommend split)
   - utils/helpers.py: 1,923 tokens (consider refactoring)

Recommended cleanup order:
1. Fix unused imports (automated)
2. Break circular dependencies 
3. Split large files
4. Reduce coupling in core modules
```

### Automated Cleanup
**You**: "Fix all the unused imports automatically"

**Claude Code**:
```
I'll clean up unused imports across the codebase.
```
*Uses `analyze_code_quality` with `fix_imports=true`*

**Result**: 47 unused imports removed from 23 files

### Dependency Cycle Breaking
**You**: "Help me break the circular dependency between models.py and services.py"

**Claude Code**: 
*Analyzes the circular dependency and provides refactoring plan*

```
Circular Dependency Analysis:
===========================

models.py imports:
- from services import UserService (line 15)

services.py imports: 
- from models import User, Role (line 8)

Recommended solution:
1. Create interfaces/protocols.py
2. Move UserService interface to interfaces
3. Have models depend on interface, services implement interface

This breaks the cycle: models → interfaces ← services
```

### Progress Validation
**You**: "Validate my refactoring changes"

**Claude Code**:
```
Let me validate your refactoring and check the dependency structure.
```
*Uses `analyze_dependencies` and `validate_commit`*

**Result**:
- Circular dependency eliminated ✅
- No new architectural violations ✅  
- Test coverage maintained ✅
- 3 files modified, 1 file added

## 🚀 Workflow 3: Pre-Release Quality Gate

**Scenario**: Final quality check before production release

### Comprehensive Analysis
**You**: "Perform a full quality analysis before we release version 2.0"

**Claude Code**:
```
I'll run comprehensive analysis covering dependencies, code quality, and architectural health.
```
*Uses multiple tools in sequence*

**Pre-Release Quality Report**:
```

## 🔄 Workflow 4: Continuous Integration

**Scenario**: Setting up MCP-powered CI/CD quality gates

### Pre-Commit Hook Setup
**You**: "Set up automatic quality checks for every commit"

**Claude Code**: 
*Creates pre-commit configuration using `validate_commit`*

**.pre-commit-config.yaml**:
```yaml
repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: deepflow-quality-check
        name: Deepflow Quality Analysis
        entry: deepflow-mcp-client validate_commit
        language: system
        pass_filenames: false
        args: [--project-path=., --check-dependencies, --check-patterns]
```

### CI Pipeline Integration
**GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/quality.yml`):
```yaml

        run: |
          deepflow-mcp-client analyze_code_quality \
            --project-path . \
            --analysis-type all
            
      - name: Validate Changes
        if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
        run: |
          deepflow-mcp-client validate_commit \
            --project-path . \
            --check-dependencies \
            --check-patterns
```

## 🎓 Advanced Workflow: AI-Assisted Refactoring

**Scenario**: Using AI to guide large-scale refactoring with MCP insights

### Discovery Phase
**You**: "I need to extract a microservice from this monolith. Help me identify the best boundaries."

**Claude Code**:
```
I'll analyze dependencies and coupling to identify potential service boundaries.
```
*Uses advanced dependency analysis*

**Analysis**:
- Identified 3 potential service boundaries
- Payment processing: 12 modules, low external coupling
- User management: 8 modules, moderate coupling  
- Notification system: 6 modules, high internal cohesion

### Extraction Planning
**You**: "Plan the extraction of the payment service. What dependencies need to be resolved?"

**Claude Code**: 
*Provides detailed extraction plan with dependency mapping*

### Progressive Validation
During refactoring, continuous validation:
```bash
# After each major change
deepflow-mcp-client validate_commit --check-patterns
```

**Result**: Safe, validated microservice extraction with architectural integrity maintained.

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. **Efficient Analysis Patterns**
- Start with `analyze_dependencies` to understand project structure
- Use `analyze_code_quality` for targeted improvements
- Always `validate_commit` before pushing changes

### 2. **Performance Optimization**
- MCP server caches results for 5 minutes
- Exclude large directories with `.deepflowignore`
- Use `ai_awareness=false` for faster basic analysis

### 3. **Team Workflows**
- Share MCP server across team members on development machines
- Include quality checks in PR templates
- Use generated documentation for architecture reviews

### 4. **Debugging and Monitoring**
- Check server logs: `tail -f ~/.deepflow/logs/mcp_server.log`
- Monitor performance: Server provides built-in metrics
- Use request IDs for tracing specific analyses
