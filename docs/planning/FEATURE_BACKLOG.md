# Deepflow Feature Backlog

**Last Updated:** January 2025  
**Version:** 1.0

This document tracks planned features, enhancements, and improvements for the Deepflow dependency analysis toolkit.

## üö® High Priority

### Unicode & Emoji Cleanup System
**Priority:** High  
**Effort:** Medium  
**Status:** Planned  

**Problem:**
Testing and analysis operations sometimes encounter unicode errors when processing files containing emojis or non-ASCII characters. This causes test failures and analysis pipeline disruptions.

**Solution:**
Implement a comprehensive unicode cleanup and handling system that can:
- Detect and sanitize problematic unicode characters
- Provide configurable emoji removal/replacement options
- Handle encoding issues gracefully
- Maintain file content integrity while ensuring compatibility

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Detect files with unicode/emoji content that may cause issues
- [ ] Provide cleanup utilities for different scenarios:
  - [ ] Remove all emojis
  - [ ] Replace emojis with text equivalents (üöÄ ‚Üí "[rocket]")  
  - [ ] Convert to ASCII-safe alternatives
- [ ] Integrate with existing analysis pipeline
- [ ] Add command-line options for cleanup operations
- [ ] Preserve original files with backup capability
- [ ] Handle encoding detection and conversion (UTF-8, UTF-16, etc.)
- [ ] Generate cleanup reports showing what was modified

**Technical Notes:**
- Use Python's `unicodedata` and `unidecode` libraries
- Implement regex patterns for emoji detection
- Consider locale-specific character handling
- Add comprehensive test coverage with problematic unicode examples

**Related Issues:**
- Testing pipeline unicode errors
- File analysis compatibility issues
- Cross-platform encoding inconsistencies

## üìã Medium Priority

### Enhanced Dependency Visualization
**Priority:** Medium  
**Effort:** Large  
**Status:** Planned  

**Problem:**
Current dependency visualizations could be more interactive and provide better insights for complex codebases.

**Solution:**
Enhance the visualization system with:
- Interactive graph navigation
- Filtering and search capabilities  
- Performance metrics overlay
- Export to multiple formats

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Interactive web-based dependency graphs
- [ ] Advanced filtering options (by file type, dependency type, etc.)
- [ ] Performance impact visualization
- [ ] Export to SVG, PNG, PDF formats
- [ ] Zoom and pan functionality
- [ ] Node clustering for large graphs

### Smart Refactoring Suggestions
**Priority:** Medium  
**Effort:** Large  
**Status:** Planned  

**Problem:**
Developers need intelligent suggestions for improving code structure and reducing technical debt.

**Solution:**
Implement AI-powered refactoring suggestions based on:
- Dependency analysis patterns
- Code complexity metrics
- Best practice recommendations
- Architecture pattern detection

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Detect common anti-patterns in dependencies
- [ ] Suggest refactoring opportunities
- [ ] Provide code examples for improvements
- [ ] Integration with popular IDEs
- [ ] Batch refactoring capabilities

## üìä Low Priority

### Performance Monitoring Dashboard
**Priority:** Low  
**Effort:** Medium  
**Status:** Planned  

**Problem:**
Need better visibility into analysis performance and resource usage.

**Solution:**
Create a monitoring dashboard showing:
- Analysis performance metrics
- Resource utilization
- Historical trends
- Bottleneck identification

### API Rate Limiting & Throttling
**Priority:** Low  
**Effort:** Small  
**Status:** Planned  

**Problem:**
MCP server needs protection against excessive API calls.

**Solution:**
Implement configurable rate limiting with:
- Request throttling
- User-based limits
- Graceful degradation
- Monitoring and alerts

### Multi-Language Support Expansion
**Priority:** Low  
**Effort:** Large  
**Status:** Planned  

**Problem:**
Current analysis is primarily Python-focused. Need broader language support.

**Solution:**
Add comprehensive support for:
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- Java
- C#
- Go
- Rust
