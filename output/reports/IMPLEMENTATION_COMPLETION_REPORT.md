```

### 2. Advanced Code Duplication Detection (0.8%)
**Problem**: No structural duplicate code detection capability  
**Solution**: AST-based similarity analysis with multiple algorithms

- **100% exact matches** in common patterns (print_header, teardown_method)
- **Refactoring opportunities** clearly identified

**Code Enhancement**:
```python
def _calculate_structural_similarity(self, struct1: Dict, struct2: Dict) -> float:
    similarity_scores = []
    # AST structure similarity (40% weight)
    ast_similarity = self._calculate_ast_similarity(struct1['ast_dump'], struct2['ast_dump'])
    similarity_scores.append(ast_similarity * 0.4)
    # ... additional scoring factors
```

### 3. Maintainability Index Calculations (0.5%)
**Problem**: No quantitative maintainability assessment  
**Solution**: Industry-standard Maintainability Index with comprehensive metrics

**Key Features**:
- 📐 **Standard MI Formula**: `MI = MAX(0, (171 - 5.2 * ln(HV) - 0.23 * (CC) - 16.2 * ln(LOC) + 50 * sin(sqrt(2.4 * CM))) * 100 / 171)`
- 🔍 **Halstead Volume**: Sophisticated operator/operand analysis
- 🌀 **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Decision point analysis
- 📝 **Comment Analysis**: Documentation percentage calculation
- 🎯 **Rating System**: Excellent (85-100) / Good (65-84) / Fair (45-64) / Poor (0-44)

**Analysis Results on Deepflow**:
- **3 files Excellent** (85-100 MI score)
- **1 file Good** (65-84 MI score)  
- **0 files requiring immediate attention**

**Code Enhancement**:
```python
def _calculate_halstead_volume(self, tree: ast.AST) -> float:
    # Sophisticated operator and operand analysis
    program_length = N1 + N2
    program_vocabulary = n1 + n2
    volume = program_length * math.log2(max(1, program_vocabulary))
    return max(1.0, volume)
```

### 4. Enhanced Refactoring Suggestions (0.4%)
**Problem**: Generic, non-actionable refactoring advice

  - Complex conditionals (4+ logical operators) with simplification strategies
  - Duplicate code patterns with consolidation approaches
  - Naming improvements with specific guidance
  - Parameter list issues (5+ params) with object-oriented solutions

- 📋 **Actionable Implementation Steps**: Each suggestion includes 4-6 specific steps
- 🏷️ **Priority Classification**: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW with clear criteria  
- 💡 **Code Examples**: Before/after refactoring patterns
- 📈 **Benefit Estimation**: Quantified improvement expectations

**Code Enhancement**:
```python
def _detect_long_methods(self, tree: ast.AST, file_path: Path, lines: List[str]) -> List[RefactoringSuggestion]:
    if method_lines > 30:  # Long method threshold
        suggestion = RefactoringSuggestion(
            suggestion_type="extract_method",
            priority="HIGH" if method_lines > 50 else "MEDIUM",
            implementation_steps=[
                f"1. Identify logical sections in '{node.name}' method",
                "2. Extract each section into a separate method with descriptive names",
                # ... detailed steps
            ],
            code_example=self._generate_extraction_example(node, lines)
        )
```

### 5. Code Complexity Visualization (0.2%)
**Problem**: No visual representation of code complexity  
**Solution**: Text-based complexity charts with clear thresholds

**Key Features**:
- 📊 **Visual Complexity Charts**: Text-based bar charts with █ characters
- 🎚️ **Threshold System**: Simple (1-5) / Moderate (6-10) / Complex (11-20) / Very Complex (21+)
- 🎯 **Targeted Analysis**: Only visualizes functions with complexity > 5
- 💡 **Priority Recommendations**: Urgent/High/Moderate action items
- 📈 **Scalable Rendering**: Responsive bar lengths based on complexity

**Code Enhancement**:
```python
def _create_complexity_chart(self, complexity: int) -> str:
    if complexity <= 5:
        level, bar = "Simple", "█" * min(complexity, 10)
    elif complexity <= 10:
        level, bar = "Moderate", "█" * min(complexity, 15)
    # ... progressive complexity visualization
    return f"Complexity: {complexity} ({level})\nVisual: {bar}\n..."
```

### 6. Import Cleanup (Immediate Impact)
**Problem**: 139 unused imports across codebase  
**Solution**: Systematic cleanup of core files

**Cleanup Results**:
